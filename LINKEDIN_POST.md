**Headline:** 🚀 Bridging Project Management & AI: Introducing AI-Kanban

Excited to open-source my latest project, **AI-Kanban** – a next-generation project management tool that leverages Large Language Models to automate technical documentation.

As an AI Specialist, I've seen how much time developers spend translating ideas into requirements. I built AI-Kanban to solve this by integrating **OpenAI (GPT-4o)**, **Anthropic (Claude 3.5)**, and **Google Gemini** directly into the workflow.

**✨ Key Features:**
*   ✍️ **AI Card Assistant**: Intelligent writing aid to help you articulate task descriptions clearly.
*   📝 **Automated PRDs**: Instantly generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents from simple card descriptions.
*   💡 **Smart Brainstorming**: AI analyzes your project data to suggest new cards and features.
*   🚀 **AI-Ready Output**: Generated PRDs are optimized for direct use in AI coding tools like **Claude Code** and **Google Antigravity**.
*   🧠 **Multi-Model Intelligence**: Smart fallback system that auto-selects the best available LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).

I'm releasing this as **Open Source (MIT)** to contribute to the community and invite fellow developers to collaborate. Whether you're interested in RAG, agentic workflows, or modern web dev, I'd love your feedback and PRs!
